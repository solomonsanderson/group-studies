# 2023 Group Studies - Atom Interferometery
## Solomon Sanderson 

Working with an Arduino MKR Vidor 4000 and using its FPGA to acheive precise
timing to control a laser for atom interferometry.

Files:
* ``` arduinocode``` contains the sketch to be uploaded to the Arduino
* ```FPGA``` contains the Verilog and quartus files for programming the FPGA on board the Arduino.
* ```bytesreverse.cmd``` is a commmand script which runs a python script to reverse a .ttf file and saves the output (app.h) in the arduino script.
