#arduinocode\EmptySketch\README.md
* `EmptySketch.ino`: contains code for writing the bitstream to the FPGA, any
 code that we want to run on the SAMD21 microprocessor is also written here.

* `app.h` : this is a C++ header file which contains the reversed bit stream
 generated by the [ReverseByte.py](https://github.com/solomonsanderson/group-studies/blob/main/FPGA/vidordemo/projects/MKRVIDOR4000_template/output_files/ReverseByte.py) script from the [.ttf file](https://github.com/solomonsanderson/group-studies/blob/main/FPGA/vidordemo/projects/MKRVIDOR4000_template/output_files/MKRVIDOR4000.ttf).

* `jtag.c` and `jtag.h` are files for uploading the bit stream to the FPGA.
